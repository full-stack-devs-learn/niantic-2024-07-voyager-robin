Class: Rectangle

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
            * Perimeter isn't calculated correctly; expected value is
              2 * width + 2 * height, while actual value is width + height.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
            * getPerimeter(), line 57

        What test helped you find the bug?
            * isPerimeterCalculatedCorrectly()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
            * Replaced "return width + height;" with
              "return (2 * width) + (2 * height);"

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
            * Area does not default to 0 if width or height are negative.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
            * getArea(), line 42

        What test helped you find the bug?
            * areAreaAndPerimeterPositive()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
            * replaced "return width * height;" with
                       "if(width <= 0 || height <= 0)
                           {
                               return 0;
                           }
                       return width * height;"

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
            * Gregor said there was no third bug in this class,
            but class variables are declared publicly rather than privately

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
            * Rectangle.java, lines 5 & 6

        What test helped you find the bug?
            * Jane pointed it out after asking Gregor about the number of bugs

        What did you do to fix the bug?
            * Replaced "public" with "private" for all class variable declarations.




Class: Quiz

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
            * The calculation for percentage score returns zero unless the score
              is 100%; this is due to the int datatype cutting off decimal points
              mid-calculation.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
            * getPercent, line 37

        What test helped you find the bug?
            * isPercentageCalculatedCorrectly()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
            * typecast score to double in the calculation, then typecast the entire result back to
              int to conform with the datatype used.

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
            * The letter grade function incorrectly assigns
              'B' to a score of 90, 'C' to a score of 80, etc.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
            * getLetterGrade(), lines 44-47

        What test helped you find the bug?
            * isLetterGradeCorrect()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
            * in the if-else block of getLetterGrade, replace
              '>' with '>=' on lines 44-47.

    Bugs 3 & 4:

            Describe the bug/error:
                * There is no code that guarantees that possiblePoints
                  and score are positive.

            Where was the bug? (function, line number)
                * setScore(), line 16
                  Quiz constructor, line 31

            What test helped you find the bug?
                * isScorePositive(), isPossiblePointsPositive()

            What did you do to fix the bug?
                * Added an if-clause to change negative values to
                  positive ones while printing out an error message.
